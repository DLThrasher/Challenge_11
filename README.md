# Challenge_11


#In this challenge I worked on identifying the reltationship between the search trends on Mercado Libre, their sales, and stock price. After identifying this relationship and correlations between the three I attempted to predict any future patterns using Facebook Prophet. There was some success, however ultimately some of my errors proved to be difficult to overcome here.
